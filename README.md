KillProcess
===========

A sample program to kill all running notepad.exe in a current user system.

It can be generalized to kill any process, just by replacing the EXE mentioned in the program.

It will be hugely useful to clear residue EXEs, if you feel tired of deleting it one by one using task Manager.

WARNING: Do not use it for any unrecoverable system EXE.

Cheers,
